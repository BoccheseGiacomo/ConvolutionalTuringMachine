# Convolutional Turing Machine (CTM): studying Meta-Learning Emergence from Cellular Automata

## Introduction

The CTM is a research project designed to explore adaptive learning systems within computational models, drawing inspiration from the dynamic behaviors of Lenia-like cellular automata. Central to its design is the use of convolution operations in a two-dimensional geometric space, enhanced by Adaptive Computation Time (ACT) for introducing halting properties and flow control. This mechanism positions the CTM as a finite state approximation of a universal Turing machine.

What sets the CTM apart is its inherent structure that not only enables spontaneous meta-learning but also allows the emergence of self-reinforcement learning and dynamic memory organization.

## Project Vision and Objectives

CTM is envisioned as a cellular automaton with an inherent capacity for learning and adaptability. Its central goal is to demonstrate the emergence of desired behaviors and to theoretically model any algorithm or function, provided ample space and computation time. The project is anchored in several key objectives:

- **Meta-Learning and Beyond**: The model aspires to not only learn but to develop internal learning algorithms, adapting and refining its strategies based on the feedback received. Theoretical considerations suggest the possibility of second-order meta-learning, where the CTM could evolve internal-rewards, guiding itself towards optimal behaviors with the maximum data efficiency and generalization abilities.
  
- **Complex Behavior Simulation**: The kernel of the CTM is analogous to a stencil in differential equations, capable of simulating intricate behaviors akin to those observed in nonlinear partial differential equations. This ability opens the door to modeling complex physical structures, potentially emulating the spatial configurations of neuronal networks.

## Challenges and Training

One of the most intriguing yet challenging aspects of the CTM is its training process. The project steps away from conventional optimization methods used in Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), such as gradient descent, and instead embraces a more exploratory approach:

- **Genetic Algorithms for Exploration**: Training the CTM is envisioned to rely heavily on genetic algorithms. The focus is on exploration, encouraging a wide variety of policies and behaviors to be experimented with.
- **Complex Training Dynamics**: Given the theoretical capabilities of the CTM, training it to harness these abilities is an ambitious endeavor. The model needs to propagate information effectively, construct complex internal models, and potentially develop its reinforcement learning algorithms.

## Current State and Future Directions

The CTM project is in its nascent stages, with training methodologies and practical applications still under development. The current focus is on understanding the theoretical limits and practical capabilities of the model, particularly in training it to achieve the envisioned emergent behaviors.

## Installation and Usage
The actual setup is manual: you need to clone the repo and go with your python environment.
